# Leetcode Chellanges  

Here are few of those leetcode chellanges that I have solved particularly in `golang`. I have described the problems below. The codes can be accessed through the links, provided along with the respective codes themselves.  

## 1. [Two Sum](./twoSum.go) <sub>\[easy\]</sub>  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.  
You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.  
You can return the answer in any order.  

**Example 1:**  
```  
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].  
```  

**Example 2:**  
```  
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
Output: [1,2]  
```  

**Example 3:**  
```  
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6  
Output: [0,1]  
```  

**Constraints:**  
> 2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>3</sup>  
> -10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>  
> -10<sup>9</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>9</sup>  
> **Only one valid answer exists.**
