# Crash-Course

This short crash-course on `golang` covers almost every key features that one should be aware of. It is inspired by a _go in 1 video tutorial_ by **Derek Banas**. Here I have arranged provided **six** main `.go` files those cover the entire requirements. One will find it very easy in terms of execution as well as understing.  
The code is articulated with the proper comments, wherever it was needed. One can access these all files directly through this directory. In order to assess any particular file separatly, navigate using following links:  
1. `advance.go`  
2. `basics.go`  
3. `dynamicGo.go`  
4. `levelUp.go`  
5. `moreOOPs.go`  
6. `server.go`
